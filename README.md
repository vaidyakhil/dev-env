## Developer-Env Customizations

- this repository contains scripts and example system config filesin order to replicate dev-env across
  machines
- this is supposed to work with [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), so first install that!
- contents of `$ZSH/custom` directory can then be replaced with this repository
